## Issue Reporting Guidelines

- The issue list of this repo is **exclusively** for bug reports and feature requests. Non-conforming issues will be closed immediately.

- Try to search for your issue, it may have already been answered or even fixed in the master branch.

- Check if the issue is reproducible with the latest stable version of vue-i18n-extensions. If you are using a pre-release, please indicate the specific version you are using.

- It is **required** that you clearly describe the steps necessary to reproduce the issue you are running into. Issues with no clear repro steps will not be triaged. If an issue labeled "need repro" receives no further input from the issue author for more than 5 days, it will be closed.

- For bugs that involves build setups, you can create a reproduction repository with steps in the README.

- If your issue is resolved but still open, donâ€™t hesitate to close it. In case you found a solution by yourself, it could be helpful to explain how you fixed it.

## Pull Request Guidelines

- The `next` branch is basically just a snapshot of the latest stable release. All development should be done in dedicated branches. **Do not submit PRs against the `next` branch.**

- Checkout a topic branch from the relevant branch, e.g. `next`, and merge back against that branch.

- Work in the `src` folder and **DO NOT** checkin `dist` and `lib` in the commits.

- It's OK to have multiple small commits as you work on the PR - we will let GitHub automatically squash it before merging.

- Make sure `pnpm test` passes. (see [development setup](#development-setup))

- If adding new feature:

  - Add accompanying test case.
  - Provide convincing reason to add this feature. Ideally you should open a suggestion issue first and have it greenlighted before working on it.

- If fixing a bug:
  - Provide detailed description of the bug in the PR. Live demo preferred.
  - Add appropriate test coverage if applicable.

### Work Step Example

- Fork the repository from [intlify/vue-i18n-extensions](https://github.com/intlify/vue-i18n-extensions) !
- Create your topic branch from `master`: `git branch my-new-topic origin/master`
- Add codes and pass tests !
- Commit your changes: `git commit -am 'Add some topic'`
- Push to the branch: `git push origin my-new-topic`
- Submit a pull request to `master` branch of `intlify/vue-i18n-extensions` repository !

## Development Setup

After cloning the repo, run:

    $ pnpm install

### Commonly used NPM scripts

    # watch and serve with hot reload unit test at localhost:8080
    $ pnpm dev

    # lint source codes
    $ pnpm lint

    # run unit tests
    $ pnpm test:unit

    # build all dist files, including npm packages
    $ pnpm build

    # run the full test suite, include linting
    $ pnpm test

There are some other scripts available in the `scripts` section of the `package.json` file.

The default test script will do the following: lint with ESLint -> unit tests with coverage. **Please make sure to have this pass successfully before submitting a PR.** Although the same tests will be run against your PR on the CI server, it is better to have it working locally beforehand.
